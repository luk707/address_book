## Serving the project locally
After you have cloned the project to your machine, `cd` into the root project directory and run the following commands:

```
$ npm i
$ npm run build
$ npm i serve -g
$ serve -s build
```

This will make a production build of the project and serve it on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Potential additions
- Users could filter the contacts via search or distance
- Users could synchronise contacts between devices (requires server)
